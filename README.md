#What is PPL?
PPL is an acronym for the weight training schedule that focuses on splitting the workouts into 3 body groups: upper body pulling muscles, upper body pushing muscles and legs. Each group is then trained separately on its own workout day. 

- Push Day - Chest, Shoulders and Triceps
- Pull Day - Back and Biceps
- Leg Day - Quads, Hamstrings and Calves

The schedule can be run a couple of different ways, but this app will be provide the user with two options: The fixed 6-Day classic schedule (Sunday Off) or the 5-Day flexible schedule (Weekends Off).

**6 Day Classic Schedule (Sunday Off)**
- Monday: Push
- Tuesday: Pull
- Wednesday: Legs
- Thursday: Push
- Friday: Pull
- Saturday: Legs
- Sunday: Rest

#What routine will be used for this application?
For the application, I'll be using a routine that's fairly popular on [r/Fitness](http://reddit.com/r/fitness), [A Linear Progression Based PPL Program for Beginners by Metallicapd] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/).

After getting permission from the creator of this routine, I've decided to go ahead and turn this routine into an app to help promote the routine and provide beginners with an alternative to the usual "build your strength base by doing a strength training program first" advice.

#Core Functionalities of the PPL Application
When it comes to working out, aside from consistency and keeping track of your diet (that's a whole different app idea), keeping track of what you've done in the gym is key. Some people like to keep it old school by bringing a notebook and pen to the gym, some have complicated apps that have all this extra fluff that isn't conducive to your workout, and some even use the notes app and a timer (ew!). The PPL App will aim to do the absolutely necessary things to tracking your workouts and do them well.


- **Simple Workout Logging Interface & Functionality** - The most important part of this app, or any workout app, should be logging your workouts. When I'm in the gym the last thing I want to do is fumble through screens trying to log my workout. It's key to make this process as simple as possible. As soon as you select the number of reps for your set, the rest countdown will start and then go off when it's time for another set.

- **Visually Appealing Workout Progression** - Sure, looking at your weight numbers increase workout-to-workout is great, but when you see the progression of your body? That's a different type of visual. Not only does it provide motivation, but it's also validation that you're putting in work.

- **Carefully Selected Video Demonstrations of Exercises** - How much you're able to lift doesn't matter if you're doing it incorrectly. Lifting with bad form may change the whole exercise and you might end up targeting the wrong muscle and possibly hurt yourself. By hand selecting the top resources of how to do certain exercises and providing them to the user, the PPL app will help the user reach their goals in an efficient and safe manner.
